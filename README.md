# clj-heroku-api

An always-up-to-date Heroku API client for Clojure.

The Heroku platform API provides a [JSON-schema](http://json-schema.org/) describing
the resources exposed through the API and any commands which can be performed against those
resources. The clj-heroku-api library downloads and caches this schema when creating a client
connection and uses the schema to construct REST resource paths and request bodies.

**NOTE:** This library is still in early development, and subject to change at any time.
I intend to follow SemVer/[BreakVer](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/encore/blob/master/BREAK-VERSIONING.md)
versioning semantics, so prior to v1.0.0, watch out for breaking changes!


## Usage

```clojure
(def client (create-client "heroku-api-auth-token"))

(api-action client "apps" "create"
  []
  {"name"   "test-app"
   "region" "us"
   "stack"  "cedar"})

(api-action client "dyno" "create"
  ["test-app"]
  {"size" "2X"})

```


## Todo

* Parameter/property validation based on API schema
* Macros to auto-generate API namespaces/functions for each resource/command
* Cleaner support for header-based features
  * [Caching](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-reference#caching)
  * [Data Integrity](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-reference#data-integrity)
  * [Response Ranges](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-reference#ranges)
